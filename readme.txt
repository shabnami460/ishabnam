A starter theme called ishabnam, or underscores.

== Description ==
This is a simple theme created to put more focus on the content than the theme itself.
It was created to serve as a portfolio thus, the main navigation has been kept simple
with three menus. Additional pages cam be added easily by going to the Pages tab in Wordpress.
The theme also has a custom menu option, which allows user to switch the color scheme, allowing
them to turn all the pink elements in the theme to purple. This option can be found under
Appearance>Theme Options, where there's a simple drop down to choose between the two. 
Additionally, there's a custom signature tag which only shows up on single content pages
at the bottom right corner of the screen. The name of the signature can also be changed
by simply typing the new desired titile in the text box in the Theme Options page.
